       <p>Due to familiarity and habit, people live their lives obliviously- unconsciously. However, there always comes this moment of awakenness and strangeness of the uniformity of life. Humans seem to be born with the thirst in their hearts to transcend deeper into a concept, a body, or their own beings. Thus, lifelessness is interrupted by a longing to understand, feel, or grasp a moment. These usually come with spurts of soreness, most likely from brokenness. In this way, humans are invited to delve deeper into thought in order to transcend the seasonal cycles of life. 
<br>
I have yet to experience a real transcendence from this lifelessness. Humans surely seem to be awakened by these sudden discomforts, but they remain inside of the boundaries drawn out by their human experiences. There is no real transcendence. Instead there is a transcendence of attitude- of behavior. We live in this gray area where we mute out anything that discourages or moves us to act, to think. We have been taught by the world to accept the gray area. When one understands their weakness, guilt, pain that they carry every day, they should be moved to fix it - to do something about it, but the world teaches us how to grow comfortable in it - to swim in it - rest in it. 
   <br>
Venomenology is a visual representation of what this practice of delving, of transcending into this gray area looks like. In other words, what resting in our brokenness looks like. This activity first introduced itself to me as a reflection of the self that is carried through different mediums, which act as filters for our minds to understand our own psyches. Thus, I realized how I could transfer a phsycial replication of the self from the laptop camera to the projector to the broken mirrors to the walls.This was practiced over and over again, which taught me how deep levels of self-recognition can go. My ideas and experimentation was later challenged by the idea of audience interaction and how that could radically change a piece. I meditated on ways that I could illustrate this idea of audience interaction in my piece. Thus, I came across the thought journal. While the participant sat in front of the laptop camera (though they were to do whatever they pleased), they were encouraged by the blank pages of the thought journal. Many participants wrote down their deepest thoughts, phrases, quotes, drawings, etc. I scanned all of these as images and added them to the recording of their mirrored images. Though my intentions were solely to express my struggle with the idea of transcendentalism, I was able to invite other bystanders of this phenomena. However, in the end (after a couple layers of this practice), I found myself still satiated in this gray area. 
<br>
Venomenology is a representation of the struggles of dissatisfaction humankind has suffered from the beginning of time. Each new moment is followed by a greater numbness that raises our standards of pleasure, joy, excitement, fear, pain. Thus, I invite people to come reverse their deepest thoughts - to un-do, un-wind in order to understand.
